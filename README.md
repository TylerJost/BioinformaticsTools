# Personal-Projects
Just some personal projects I made for class and personal use. 

## Beyonce vs. Taylor Swift
Who is better, Beyonce or Taylor Swift? I don't know, and I can tell you my computer doesn't know. This showcases my webscraping skills (to get lyrics) as well as some text mining and sentiment analysis. 

One thing to note is that, at least the way I did it, sentiment analysis simply doesn't work. For example, Taylor Swift has a really positive song "Shake it Off". But she says the word "hate" so many times it gave a really low score. 

## Education vs. Income Inequity in Texas
I loooked at 8th grade algebra scores for every district in Texas. I think took county positional information and found what county was closest to what district. I was hoping to get a better sense of how economic positions affected test scores. I'm not really convinced my final results reflect what's really going on. 

## Footstrike Predictor
I use a basic logistic regression to predict what kind of foostrike a person will have based on several kinematic variables. This isn't all that useful because it has forceplate data already but it was fun to start using scikit  learn. 

## Steganography
I briefly got really into classical ciphers which led me to steganography, which is hiding data in images. Here I put a bunch of sonnets into an image of the Baylor Sciences Building. Currently working towards a decoding function as well as a way to store images.
